# organize-my-apps
A tool to keep track of your employment applications! Part of Organize My Suite!

## About this project
Organize My Apps! started as a personal call to action by the lack of ways to keep track of internship applications.

Not sure about you, but when I apply for summer internships or co-ops, I go *hard*. Typically, in any given season,
my list of companies ranges from 20 to up to 30 applications.

#### that's kind of a lot, Bruno

Ya, ok lol
But my only alternative was to use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, both of which are excellent general purpose tools, but
lack features that are specific to my use case.

Enter Organize My Apps!, a software product designed for anyone looking for a job (every human being over the age of 16, but
especially college students).

## Cool stuff about this project
Although it did not start out this way, this project has turned into an experiment into the world of *Product Management (PM).*
A *PM* is someone who is responsible for the vision and end to end planning of a product or feature (not necessarily
software based). PMs will conduct user market research, seek appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs, i.e. success metrics),
and generally see that the product in question is successful.

This project was originally developed not just for me, but for the Stevens Institute of Technology Society of Hispanic
Professional Engineers (SHPE) chapter. I knew that many of the chapter members (including myself) would be attending the
annual SHPE National Convention in 2019 and so I wanted to create a neat platform to ease the process of keeping track of all
the applications going out to all these different companies.
